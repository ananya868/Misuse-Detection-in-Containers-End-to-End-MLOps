The dir contains notebooks for Bi-variate and Multi-Variate analysis and correlation among them: 

o	Bivariate Analysis: 
    - Explore relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps.
o	Multivariate Analysis: 
    - Use methods like pair plots and parallel coordinates plots to analyse relationships among multiple variables.

Correlations:
o	Correlation Matrix: 
    - Compute and visualize the correlation between numeric variables.
o	Heatmaps:
