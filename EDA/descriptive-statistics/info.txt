The directory involves two steps in EDA:
    o   Summary Statistics: 
            - Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles and draw insights
    o	Distribution Analysis: 
            -Plot histograms, box plots, and KDE plots to understand the distribution of variables and draw insights

    

Note: 
Since the number of features in this dataset is large 
We divided the features based on their technical category (according to Computer Networking Theory)

Thus, this directory includes separate files for each category 
Each category contain specific features 
There are total 12 categories and 1 Target feature 

Examples:
Basic Flow information (7 features), Flow Duration and Packet counts (3 features), etc .....


Detailed information on this categorical separation is provided in the feature-info.txt file in project's base directory
