### Information on Labels

Benign
Description: This label refers to normal, non-malicious activity. It indicates that the actions or behaviors captured in the dataset do not exhibit any signs of security threats or misuse.

CVE-2020-13379
Description: This is a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier for a specific vulnerability. CVE-2020-13379 refers to a vulnerability discovered in GitLab, where an attacker could exploit a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability by tricking the server into making unintended requests.

Node-RED Reconnaissance
Description: Node-RED is a flow-based development tool for visual programming. Reconnaissance in this context refers to activities aimed at gathering information about Node-RED instances, such as identifying exposed endpoints, available resources, or other sensitive information that could be used for further attacks.

Node-RED RCE
Description: RCE stands for Remote Code Execution. This label indicates exploits or attacks that target Node-RED instances to execute arbitrary code remotely. This is a severe type of vulnerability as it allows attackers to run malicious code on the affected system.

Node-RED Container Escape
Description: This refers to vulnerabilities or exploitation techniques that allow an attacker to break out of the Node-RED container, gaining access to the underlying host system. Container escapes are critical because they can lead to compromised host security.

CVE-2021-43798
Description: This CVE identifier corresponds to a specific vulnerability discovered in Grafana, an open-source analytics and monitoring platform. CVE-2021-43798 is a directory traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to read files on the server.

CVE-2019-20933
Description: This CVE identifier pertains to a vulnerability in the Harbor container registry, which could allow attackers to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions. Specific details of this vulnerability would need to be cross-referenced for precise information.

CVE-2021-30465
Description: This CVE identifier refers to a specific vulnerability in the container runtime software runC. CVE-2021-30465 is a flaw that can be exploited to achieve container escape or escalate privileges on the host system.

CVE-2021-25741
Description: This CVE identifier refers to a vulnerability in Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. CVE-2021-25741 is a security issue that can lead to unauthorized access or actions within a Kubernetes cluster.

CVE-2022-23648
Description: This CVE identifier corresponds to a vulnerability in the container runtime software containerd, which is used by Kubernetes and Docker. CVE-2022-23648 is a security issue that could allow for container escape or privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5736
Description: This CVE identifier refers to a major vulnerability in the Docker container runtime (runC), which allows attackers to break out of a container and execute code on the host system. This vulnerability is known for being particularly severe and widely impactful.

DSB Nuclei Scan
Description: DSB likely stands for a specific project or organization, while Nuclei is a fast, customizable vulnerability scanner based on simple YAML-based templates. This label indicates that the dataset includes results or activities related to scanning for vulnerabilities using the Nuclei tool.
